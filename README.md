## About Me.
***
My name is Malina Fran√ßa, and I'm a trans woman developer from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

Internet has been a passion for me since I was thirteen, and now I'm twenty. Since that early age, I was already messing with Tumblr and forums themes through HTML and CSS. Not so often I had success at my attempts, but I never gave up on trying to learn and find out what was wrong. Happily, my ease of learning along with my curiosity led me here and I'm sure it will take me even further.

Have a sit while I take the cookies out of the oven! :cookie:
