# Hi! There you are. The coffee is still warm. ![ezgif-5-bd9f4c738e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104470227/211219475-0f30bb6b-9d29-4300-a43d-a4bdb55177dc.gif)

### My name is Malina Fran√ßa, and I'm a trans woman developer from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

Internet has been a passion for me since I was thirteen, and now I'm twenty. Since that early age, I was already messing with Tumblr and forums themes through HTML and CSS. Not so often I had success at my attempts, but I never gave up on trying to learn and find out what was wrong. Happily, my ease of learning along with my curiosity led me here and I'm sure it will take me even further.

Have a sit while I take the cookies out of the oven! :cookie:

 1. Currently studying **Javascript**, mostly focused in **ReactJS** and **NodeJS**. :woman_technologist: 
 2. I'm also looking for an opportunity at practising and learning with some cool and diverse team! :partying_face: 
 3. I like to think about myself like a meeting between two worlds. Thus, I like to think how can we connect the concrete, logical side of programming with the abstract, emotional side of our intimacy. This is probably my biggest challenge in this career. :dizzy:
 4. Besides programming, literature is one of my biggest loves. I even was enrolled in the Language course over two years at Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro! Turned out I loved more writing codes than reading books. :smile: 
 5. By the way, my favorite book is '*The Secret History*', by Donna Tartt. Meet me at [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/conjectrix), so we can talk more about each other readings! :bookmark: 
 6. Another big passion is music. Find me at [LastFM](https://www.last.fm/user/Sevdaliza) and send me our compatibility level! :dancer: 
 7. Lastly, I would love to connect to you better! And I think [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malinafranca/) may be the best option for that. Feel free to send me any questions and contribute to any publication! :ok_hand:
